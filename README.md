## üìú Project Overview & Vision

Chereka AI is an Ethiopia-based AI web application designed to bridge the language and cultural gap in modern AI tools. Unlike most AI platforms that primarily serve English-speaking users, Chereka integrates **Amharic**, **Afaan Oromo**, and **English** into a unified intelligent assistant capable of natural conversation, voice interaction, and localized services.

**Launch Goal:** 2026  
**Current Version:** AP1  
**Core Objective:** Provide an accessible, culturally relevant AI experience for Ethiopia while maintaining global usability standards.

### Vision

By 2026, Chereka aims to:  
- Be the **primary AI assistant** for Ethiopians across sectors such as education, business, government, and personal productivity.  
- Offer **accurate, natural, and context-aware** communication in Amharic and Afaan Oromo.  
- Integrate **Ethiopian-specific knowledge** including local news, culture, and educational curriculum.  
- Support **offline-capable features** to serve areas with limited internet connectivity.  
- Become a platform that **learns and evolves daily** to reflect Ethiopia‚Äôs dynamic culture and needs.

## üóÇ Feature-by-Feature Technical Explanation

### 1. Chat
- Users can interact via text or voice inputs.  
- Inputs are sent to the backend API, which communicates with the AI model.  
- Responses are optionally translated based on detected user language.  
- Conversations are saved to user history for continuity and learning.

### 2. Voice Mode
- Captures user speech with Web Speech API and converts it to text.  
- Text is processed by AI and converted back to speech using TTS APIs.  
- Language detection ensures correct voice profiles and dialects are used.

### 3. Translation
- Automatically detects input language among Amharic, Afaan Oromo, and English.  
- Uses translation APIs for real-time language switching and multi-language support.  
- Ensures AI responses are delivered in the user‚Äôs preferred language seamlessly.

### 4. News
- Fetches current Ethiopian and international news headlines through NewsAPI.  
- AI summarizes or contextualizes news articles to make them easier to understand.  
- Provides localized cultural insights related to the news.

## üß† AI & NLP Implementation Details

### Model Choices
- Primary AI models include OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4.1 or GPT-3.5 for high-quality reasoning and generation.  
- Backup models use Hugging Face‚Äôs open-source transformer models (e.g., BLOOM, LLaMA 2) for offline or cost-effective scenarios.

### Prompt Engineering
- Customized system prompts guide the AI‚Äôs tone, politeness, and bilingual capabilities.  
- Contextual prompts enable memory of past interactions to maintain coherent conversations.

### Safety Layers
- Offensive language filters prevent inappropriate content.  
- Topic restrictions block sensitive or harmful subjects.

### Caching
- Frequently asked questions and common queries are cached for instant responses.  
- Caches stored in Redis or Firestore to balance performance and cost.

## üó£ Voice Mode & Language Handling (Amharic, Afaan Oromo, English)

### Input Flow
1. User speech is captured via the **Web Speech API** for real-time voice recognition.  
2. Speech is transcribed into text in the client app.  
3. Language detection algorithms analyze the transcription to determine whether the input is in Amharic, Afaan Oromo, or English.  
4. The transcribed and detected language text is sent to the backend AI for processing.

### Output Flow
1. The AI generates a response in text form, respecting the detected or user-selected language.  
2. If voice mode is enabled, the text response is sent through a **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** API to produce natural audio output.  
3. The audio is streamed back to the user and played in the client app.  
4. If voice mode is disabled, the text response is displayed as usual.

### Language Handling Rules
- Conversations maintain the same language once detected unless the user explicitly switches languages.  
- AI responses are automatically translated if the conversation language and the AI‚Äôs internal language differ.  
- Accents and dialects specific to Amharic and Afaan Oromo are supported via customized voice models.  
- Language fallback ensures fallback to English if the system cannot confidently interpret the input language.
